An experimental documentation generator for Dart.

## What's this?

An experimental documentation generator for Dart; the main design features are:

- fast generation
- output one page per library and per class (instead of a page per symbol)
- output rendered in a SPA web app
- few configuration options for the CLI tool
- designed to be used as a library for sophisticated use cases (documenting the
  Dart SDK, the Flutter SDK, ...)

## Infima and Docusaurus

The CSS page layout for this API generator are sourced from the excellent
[Infima](https://infima.dev/) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) projects.
