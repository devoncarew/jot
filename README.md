An experimental documentation generator for Dart projects.

## What's this?

An experimental documentation generator for Dart; the main design features are:

- fast documentation generaion
- generate one page per library and per class (instead of a page per symbol)
- output rendered in a SPA web app
- very few configuration options for the CLI tool
- designed to be used as a library for sophisticated use cases (documenting the
  Dart SDK, the Flutter SDK, ...)
